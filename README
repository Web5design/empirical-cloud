This is a little project to visualize owl:sameAs links in the Billion Triple 
Challenge Dataset. http://challenge.semanticweb.org/

After downloading the BTC data into a directory called data you can generate 
the json file that is used to display the graph with the following:

zgrep -h 'http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#sameAs' data/btc-2010-chunk-*.gz | \
    scripts/quadtab.pl | \
    scripts/sameas.py | \
    sort | uniq -c | sort -rn | \
    scripts/jsonify.py > docs/sames.js

You'll need to have recent versions of Perl, Python and pygraph installed.
