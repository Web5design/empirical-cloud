        Below is a graph of <a
            href="http://www.w3.org/TR/owl-ref/#sameAs-def">owl:sameAs</a> 
        links between domain names in the 
        <a href="http://challenge.semanticweb.org/">Billion Triple Challenge</a>
        data. It is probably best viewed with a 
        webkit browser like Chrome or Safari.  In order to make the graph 
        somewhat viewable it was limited to hosts that had more than 10 
        links between them. You should be able to zoom in on portions 
        of the graph, and to hover over a node to see the hostname. 
        More about how this graph was generated can be found on 
        <a href="http://github.com/edsu/empirical-cloud">github</a>.
